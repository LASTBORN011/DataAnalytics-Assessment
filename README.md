## üìå Questions & Explanations

### Question 1: High-Value Customers with Multiple Products

**Objective:** Identify customers who have both funded savings and investment plans for cross-selling opportunities.  
**Approach:**  
- Counted funded savings plans from `savings_savingsaccount` (confirmed_amount > 0)  
- Counted funded investment plans from `plans_plan` (is_a_fund = 1)  
- Joined with `users_customuser` for customer details  
- Filtered to include customers with at least one plan in both categories  
- Sorted results by total deposits

### Question 2: Transaction Frequency Analysis

**Objective:** Categorize customers by their transaction frequency per month.  
**Approach:**  
- Calculated the number of transactions per customer per month using `savings_savingsaccount`  
- Computed average monthly transactions for each customer  
- Categorized customers into High (‚â•10), Medium (3-9), and Low (‚â§2) frequency groups  
- Summarized the counts and average transactions for each group

### Question 3: Account Inactivity Alert

**Objective:** Identify active savings or investment accounts with no inflow transactions in the last year (365 days).  
**Approach:**  
- Used `transaction_date` from `savings_savingsaccount` and `created_on` from `plans_plan`  
- Determined last transaction dates per account  
- Calculated inactivity period in days  
- Filtered for inactivity greater than 365 days  
- Returned plan/account details with inactivity metrics

### Question 4: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation

**Objective:** Estimate the CLV for each customer based on tenure and transaction history.  
**Approach:**  
- Calculated account tenure in months from `date_joined` in `users_customuser`  
- Aggregated total transactions and average transaction value from `savings_savingsaccount`  
- Used simplified CLV formula:  
  `CLV = (total_transactions / tenure_months) * 12 * avg_profit_per_transaction`  
- Assumed profit per transaction = 0.1% of transaction value (converted from kobo to Naira)  
- Sorted customers by estimated CLV descending

## üöß Challenges Faced

- Differences in actual column names versus those specified in the assessment instructions (e.g., `created_on` instead of `created_at`, `date_joined` instead of `signup_date`) required adjustments to queries.  
- Some expected columns like `confirmed_amount` were missing; used alternative columns and logic where needed.  
- Ensured all amount values were properly converted from kobo to Naira to maintain financial accuracy.  
- Calculating date differences and handling NULLs for inactive accounts required careful SQL handling.
